# Twilio Setup for Voice AI Calling

## Current Issue
You don't see "Phone Numbers" in the left menu of Twilio Console.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Find Phone Numbers Section
1. In Twilio Console, look for "Phone Numbers" under "Super Network" or "Programmable Voice"
2. OR search "Buy a Number" in the top search bar
3. OR go directly to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming

### Option 2: Use Current Setup for Testing
Since you have a verified Caller ID (+1 216 440 6890), we can test the system now:

1. **Test the App Flow**: 
   - Launch the web app
   - Select "Oil Change" 
   - Enter location and time
   - Click "Find Available Appointments"
   - Watch the console logs to see the AI conversation simulation

2. **Console Output Will Show**:
   ```
   === DEMO: AI CALLING SIMULATION ===
   1. AI would call vendor at: +12164406890
   2. AI would say: 'Hello! I'm calling on behalf of a customer who needs a same-day oil change appointment. Do you have any availability this afternoon?'
   3. Vendor (you) would respond with availability
   4. AI would confirm time and connect customer
   ```

3. **For Real Calls Later**:
   - You'll need to verify +12163860570 as a Caller ID in Twilio
   - Or purchase a Twilio phone number for $1/month

## Current Status
- App is ready for testing
- Voice AI logic is implemented
- Real Twilio integration is configured
- Console simulation shows exact conversation flow

## Next Steps
1. Test the app flow now to see the simulation
2. Later, verify your customer number in Twilio Console
3. Real voice calls will work once both numbers are verified
