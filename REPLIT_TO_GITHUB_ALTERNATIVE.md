# Alternative Ways to Get Your Code to GitHub from Replit

## Option 1: Look for Git/Version Control Icon
- Check the left sidebar for icons that look like:
  - Branch icon (git symbol)
  - "Source Control" text
  - Three dots menu â†’ "Git"
  - Sometimes it's hidden in a "Tools" menu

## Option 2: Use Replit Shell (Recommended)
1. **Open the Shell tab** (usually at bottom of screen)
2. **Run these commands one by one:**

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial SameDay025 deployment"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sameday025.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Download and Upload Method
1. **Download from Replit:**
   - Click the hamburger menu (three lines) in top left
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to your empty GitHub repository
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag all your project files into GitHub
   - Commit with message: "Initial SameDay025 deployment"

## Option 4: Replit Deployments (Alternative to Cloudflare)
If GitHub connection is difficult, you can also deploy directly from Replit:
1. Click "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Choose "Autoscale Deployment"
3. Configure custom domain to point to sameday025.com

## GitHub Repository Setup First
**Before any of the above, make sure you've created the repository:**
1. Go to github.com
2. Click green "New" button
3. Name: `sameday025`
4. Set to Public
5. Don't initialize with anything
6. Click "Create repository"

## After Code is on GitHub
1. Connect to Cloudflare Pages
2. Add environment variables
3. Configure DNS
4. Enable SSL
5. Deploy sameday025.com
